PROCEDURE:
➢ STEP 1: Objective Definition:
Begin by clearly defining the objectives of the mobile audit. Determine
whether you are focusing on security, compliance, performance, or other specific goals. Understanding the
purpose will guide the entire audit process.
➢ STEP 2: Scope Determination:
Specify the scope of the audit by identifying which mobile devices and
applications will be included. This helps in setting boundaries and ensures that you focus on the most
relevant artifacts.
➢ STEP 3: Tool Selection:
Choose the appropriate tools and resources needed for the audit. Security
audits, might include vulnerability scanners and penetration testing tools, while compliance checks
could involve auditing software or policy compliance tools.
➢ STEP 4: Data Collection:
Gather detailed information about the mobile devices and applications
under audit. This includes hardware specifications, operating system versions, and a list of installed
applications.
➢ STEP 5: Security and Compliance Checks:
Conduct security assessments, compliance checks, and vulnerability
scans. Assess aspects like encryption, authentication methods, permissions, and adherence to policies
or regulations.

STEP 6: Report Generation:
Compile the audit findings into a comprehensive report. The report should
11REG NO:722821244007
include detailed descriptions of identified issues, their severity levels, potential impact, and clear
recommendations for remediation.
➢ STEP 7: Remediation and Follow-Up:
Prioritize the issues based on their severity and address them
accordingly. Develop remediation plans and ensure that identified vulnerabilities are fixed.
Schedule follow-up audits to verify that issues have been resolved and to monitor ongoing
compliance and security.
➢ STEP 8: Documentation and Continuous Improvement:
Maintain detailed documentation of the audit process, including the
audit plan, findings, actions taken, and follow-up activities. Use this documentation to
continually improve mobile security and compliance processes and adapt to changing mobile
technology and threats.
These 8 steps provide a structured approach to conducting a mobile audit and generating a comprehensive
report for your existing artifacts. Tailor these steps to meet your organization's specific needs and
objectives.


SUMMARY:
The implementation of a mobile audit involves a systematic process aimed at inspecting and assessing
existing artifacts, typically in an organizational or project context. The primary objective is to generate
a comprehensive report that provides insights into the current state of these artifacts. This audit process
entails several key steps, starting with defining clear objectives and scope, selecting an appropriate
methodology, and assembling a proficient audit team.
Once these foundational steps are in place, the audit team identifies and documents all pertinent
artifacts for assessment. They then collect and analyze data using various methods, including code
reviews, system analyses, and documentation reviews. Risk assessment is another critical aspect of
the audit, where potential risks are evaluated, prioritized, and assessed for their impact on the
organization. Compliance and security are reviewed to ensure adherence to industry standards and
security best practices.
The audit process culminates in the creation of a comprehensive report that summarizes findings,
identifies issues, offers recommendations for improvements, and outlines an action plan. This report
is presented to relevant stakeholders for their awareness and engagement in implementing the
recommended changes. Continuous follow-up and monitoring of the action plan are necessary to track
progress and verify compliance, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of mobile artifacts'
quality, security, and compliance within the organization or project.
RESULT:
The implementation of a mobile audit and the generation of a report for existing artifacts result in
improved artifact quality, enhanced security, compliance assurance, identified issues for resolution,
actionable improvement recommendations, risk mitigation, and informed decision-making for
organizations
